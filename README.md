# Insights:
The Sales Analysis and Inventory Management Dashboard provides insights into sales trends and inventory status to help the country head make informed decisions to scale up sales numbers and optimize inventory. The dashboards offer the following insights:

1. Inventory Performance: The Inventory Performance Dashboard displays the inventory data, highlighting the category and year from highest to lowest order in terms of vendor item price. It allows comparison of End On Hand (EOH) and On Order units for the selected category and subcategory. The monthly EOH and On Order units are visualized for each year, enabling analysis of inventory trends and identifying potential stock shortages or excesses. In June 2011, the EOH value for beverages was 146,274, indicating the available stock, while the On Order value was 60,710, representing the pending orders.

2. Retailer Analysis: The Retailer Analysis Dashboard showcases the number of items for each category and facilitates the exploration of top and bottom items by stock unit. It also provides insights into the quality rating by category and vendor. This analysis helps identify vendors associated with the Produce category, such as Earthworks, Highland, and Indiewealth Corp. Additionally, the top item in the Produce category is identified as Del Monte No sugar added, which can be leveraged for targeted marketing and sales strategies.
